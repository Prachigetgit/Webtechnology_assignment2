        <b>If you cannot do great things, do small things in a great way. </b

        <b
          >The one thing that you have that nobody else has is you. Your voice,
          your mind, your story, your vision. So write and draw and build and
          play and dance and live as only you can. </b
        ><i>~Neil Gaimen</i>

        <b
          >The illiterate of the future will not be the person who cannot read.
          It will be the person who does not know how to learn. </b

        <b
          >“I'm selfish, impatient and a little insecure. I make mistakes, I am
          out of control and at times hard to handle. But if you can't handle me
          at my worst, then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best.” </b
