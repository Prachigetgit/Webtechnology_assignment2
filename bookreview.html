        The best-known secret in the city, Jane is an underground health clinic
        composed entirely of women helping women, empowering them to embrace
        their futures by offering reproductive counseling and safe, illegal
        abortions. Veronica, Jane’s founder, prides herself on the services she
        has provided to thousands of women, yet the price of others’ freedom is
        that she leads a double life. When she’s not at Jane, Veronica plays the
        role of a conventional housewife—a juggling act that becomes even more
        difficult during her own high-risk pregnancy. Two more women in
        Veronica’s neighborhood are grappling with similar disconnects.
        Margaret, a young professor at the University of Chicago, secretly
        volunteers at Jane as she falls in love with a man whose attitude toward
        his ex-wife increasingly disturbs her. Patty, who’s long been content as
        a devoted wife and mother, has begun to sense that something essential
        is missing from her life. When her runaway younger sister, Eliza, shows
        up unexpectedly, Patty must come to terms with what it really means to
        love and support a sister. In this historic moment, when the personal
        was nothing if not political, Veronica, Margaret, and Patty risk it all
        to help mothers, daughters, sisters, and friends. With an awe-inspiring
        story and appealing characters, All You Have to Do Is Call celebrates
        the power of women coming together in the face of seemingly
        insurmountable odds.
